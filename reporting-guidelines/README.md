# Reporting Guidelines

## What sort of projects should be reported to Mohinga?

Only country-level projects should be reported to Mohinga. Global and regional projects, which do not have any activities directly in Myanmar, should not be reported to Mohinga.

Where a regional project has a proportion of total funding allocated to activities that take place in Myanmar, that percentage of spending can be reported to Mohinga.

## How do we avoid double-counting in Mohinga? What happens if we report our funding in addition to our implementing partner?

Multiple levels down the delivery chain can be reported in Mohinga while avoiding double-counting. For example, if Canada disburses funds to the Global Fund, both Canada and the Global Fund can report their respective project, from their own perspective. In this case, the Global Fund should report funding received from Canada as **Incoming Funds**.

_Note: currently, dashboards throughout Mohinga do not discount for incoming funds. This is something we are considering doing in future._
