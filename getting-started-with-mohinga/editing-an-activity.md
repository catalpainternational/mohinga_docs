# Editing an Activity

### Overview of Activity Editor

* **Navigation**: on the left hand side, you will see a menu that allows you to scroll through a series of tabs to provide information about this activity. For example, the sectors that this activity relates to, or the financial data.
* **Draft / publish**: at the top right of the page, you will see a _DRAFT / PUBLISHED_ button. This allows you to toggle whether this activity is in draft mode \(where you can edit the activity, but it is not yet publicly visible\) or published \(where it is visible to all other users, including the public\). Once you are finished editing your activity, remember to make the activity published.

* **Activity Completion Rating**: on the left hand side beneath the menu, you can see the Activity Completion Rating. Clicking on `Improve my rating?` allows you to see how you can increase your completion rating for this activity.

### How to use the Activity Editor

The Activity Editor is quite straightforward to use. Click through each of the tabs in turn, providing the required information. You can periodically click the `Save` button at the bottom of the screen to save your progress without publishing the activity.

When you are finished adding information about the activity, change the `DRAFT / PUBLISHED` slider to `PUBLISHED` and click Save. This will make the activity publicly visible throughout the site.

At this point, you may be presented with a pop-up like the one below, informing you that your activity does not meet the minimum requirements to be published. Add the requested additional information and then try again to publish the activity.
